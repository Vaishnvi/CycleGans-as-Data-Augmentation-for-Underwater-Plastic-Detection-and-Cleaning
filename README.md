# CycleGans-as-Data-Augmentation-for-Underwater-Plastic-Detection-and-Cleaning
An efficient and scalable architecture for underwater plastic detection and cleaning using Underwater Autonomous Vehicle (AUV) and CycleGans as Data Augmentation technique to convert in air plastic to underwater style.

Project is in progress. I have attached videos of training cyclegans on my own dataset for converting in-air plastic to underwater style. 

Below are images for training around 60 epochs with descending G-loss and D-loss per epoch -
